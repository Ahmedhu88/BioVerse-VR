# BioVerse-VR
![alt text](/8.jpg?raw=true)

BioVerse-VR is a prototype bioinformatics virtual reality application for the Oculus Quest to visualize large biological networks. It uses two human genome datasets from the ICNB laboratory as a case study. Through these codes, the data is linked according to the dataset information, which is in the Json file, where genes can be visualized and interrelated in a three-dimensional environment and interacted with them through the control modules of the head and hand devices represented by Meta Quest.
In this project, we use virtual reality to solve problems related to the visualization of large biological networks, such as: information overload, high connectedness, and high dimensionality.



## Installation

Clone the repository locally and open it with Unity using the 2021.3.14f version. You can run the project on your Oculus Quest2 by using the Oculus Link or by creating an .apk file in order to run the application on the Oculus Quest2 hardware.

The Unity program was used to represent the network .. Later, the whole file will be added for the benefit of the developers.
