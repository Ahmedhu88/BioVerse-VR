# BioVerse-VR
BioVerse-VR is a prototype bioinformatics virtual reality application for the Oculus Quest to visualize large biological networks. It uses two human genome datasets from the ICNB laboratory as a case study. Through these codes, the data is linked according to the dataset information, which is in the Json file, where genes can be visualized and interrelated in a three-dimensional environment and interacted with them through the control modules of the head and hand devices represented by Meta Quest.
In this project, we use virtual reality to solve problems related to the visualization of large biological networks, such as: information overload, high connectedness, and high dimensionality.

The Unity program was used to represent the network .. Later, the whole file will be added for the benefit of the developers.
